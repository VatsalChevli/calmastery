					<p class="answer">Therapy is a long journey along with your therapist and requires willingness and commitment from your end since emotional wounds are not the same as physical ones which can be given an estimated time to heal. It’s your journey that would be traveled at your pace. What we can assure from our end is no compromise on the quality of services and utter professionalism. </p>

					</div><i class="material-icons drop">expand_more</i>
				</div>
				<div class="answer-wrapper">
					<p class="answer">We suggest a minimum of 7 sessions to understand the need for therapy, the issues you might be going through, the way they might be affecting you or the people around you, and the severity of it. These 7 sessions would give the therapist clarity about you and your behavioral and thought patterns as well and the more the session, the more clarity the therapist would have about you and the better the professional would be able to assist you. <br>
					However, beginners often opt for 4 or 5 sessions to get a hold of therapy and how it goes and opt for more once they have completed a few.
